        <p class="dalgona-presentation">Here is the recipe of the traditional korean cookie, the famous
            <b>Dalgona (달고나).</b> What you will need are :
        </p>
        <ul class="dalgona-ingredients">
            <li><b>2 tablespoons</b> white sugar</li>
            <li><b>¼ teaspoon</b> baking soda</li>
            <li><b>7 to 8 nuts</b> (almonds, cashew, pistachios, or peanuts), optional</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="dalgona-instruction">INSTRUCTIONS:</h3>
        <ol class="dalgona-list-instruction">
            <li>If you use nuts, place several on a baking sheet lined 
                with parchment paper, in a circle about 2 inches diameter.

            </li>

            <li>Put the sugar in a stainless steel ladle (or small pan) over 
                low heat. When the sugar starts melting, stir it with a 
                long-handled stainless or wooden spoon so it melts evenly and 
                doesn’t burn. Control the heat by lifting the ladle far from 
                the heat or bringing it closer, as needed.
            </li>

            <li>Stir the melting sugar until it turns into a smooth, 
                clear liquid with no lumps.
            </li>

            <li>Add baking soda and continue stirring. It will expand and 
                change from light brown to creamy golden beige and then it 
                will expand three times in size.
            </li>

            <li>Quickly drop the hot candy on top of the nuts. 
                Let it cool down for about 10 minutes.
            </li>

            <li>Serve right away.</li>
            
        </ol>
